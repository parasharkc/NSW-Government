## Tasks


**1. Digital Strategy Simulation**

_Activity 1: ICT Policy.Develop policy ideas to help mitigate data breaches in NSW and draft an email to the Secretary to explain the key benefits of a project to reduct data breaches._

Being a policy officer focuses on addressing public concerns. The role involves delving into complex societal challenges and devising practical, implementable solutions.Policy officers possess a thorough understanding of how government policies impact their own lives and extend that insight to the experiences of others. They excel at balancing diverse perspectives, forming well-reasoned conclusions, and constructively challenging ideas when necessary. The work isn't always about delivering tangible outputs; it often involves fostering collaboration, such as organizing discussions or brainstorming sessions to generate innovative ideas.A good policy officer requires familiarity with the following concepts: 
- The Australian political environment
- Core Government processes.

-Visiting the resources from Cybergov and NSW gov cyber initiatives, the two policies that could help minimize and mitigate the data breaches have been identified. Here is the concise email drafted to the secretary.
```
Hello Mr Secretary,

I hope this email finds you well. As you are aware, there’s been a three-fold increase in complaints about data breaches
in NSW, I believe it's time to add some new policies to help rule out the problem. 

To address the three-fold increase in data breach complaints in NSW, two policy ideas can be proposed.

1. First, implement stricter data protection regulations requiring organizations to adopt advanced encryption methods and
conduct regular audits to ensure compliance. This policy could include penalties for non-compliance, incentivizing robust
cybersecurity practices.

2. Second, launch a public awareness campaign to educate individuals and businesses on recognizing, preventing, and
responding to data breaches. This initiative could focus on common vulnerabilities, such as phishing, and promote the
use of secure technologies and practices.

These approaches aim to strengthen systemic protections and empower individuals to safeguard their data effectively.

Warm Regards,
Parashar K C

_Activity 2: Service Designer:Identify customer requirements for the End of Life Journey service offering._ You are a graduate with NSW Government, working in a real-world Service Design team at the digital.nsw Accelerator Lab (DNA Lab). Your team will develop a more effective approach to an unmet need in the community – the End of Life journey, which addresses the challenges that friends and relatives will need to navigate after their loved one dies. Your manager has asked you to define the problem. What are the key issues that the team will need to consider when developing tools and processes to support the End of Life journey?

- Who will use the tools and processes?
- What are the users’ key needs?
- Where are the gaps and problems with the current situation?


Resources:
- [Navigating end of life journeys](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/article/navigating-end-of-life-journeys)
- [New Zealand Government's End of Life Service](https://endoflife.services.govt.nz/welcome)

-After conducting research on the subject, the following information has been identified to define the problem for the End of Life Journey.
```
End of life Journey: When someone dies it's important to let the right people know as quickly as you can. While it can be
difficult to think and talk about such an emotive topic, the goal is to make this distressing time less complicated for
NSW citizens to navigate.

Key Issues to Consider:
- Complexity of Processes: Families and friends face intricate administrative, legal, and emotional tasks after a loved
one's passing, such as arranging funerals, managing estates, and handling government documentation​.
- Emotional Sensitivity: Tools and processes need to acknowledge and accommodate the emotional distress of users during
this difficult time.
- Cultural and Accessibility Considerations: The system must address diverse cultural practices and ensure accessibility
for all users, including those with disabilities or limited digital skills.

Target Users:
- Primary Users: Family members, friends, and legal representatives of the deceased.
- Secondary Users: Funeral directors, legal advisors, and service providers assisting with the end-of-life journey.

Users’ Key Needs:
- Streamlined Information: A centralized and easy-to-navigate platform to guide users through steps like notifying
organizations, applying for financial support, and managing legal responsibilities.
- Personalization: Tools to tailor information and advice based on the user's situation, such as cultural practices
 or the specific documents required​.
- Support and Guidance: Resources for emotional support, FAQs, and clear instructions to reduce confusion.

Gaps and Problems in the Current Situation:
- Fragmented Information: Users often have to navigate multiple websites and contact various organizations, leading
to redundancy and frustration.
- Lack of Awareness: Many people are unaware of existing tools and resources, such as the Te Hokinga ā Wairua End of
Life Service.
- Limited Digital Accessibility: Current platforms may not fully cater to non-digital users or those with low digital
literacy​

Project Summary for Press Release:

The Department of Social Affairs (DSA) has launched an ambitious initiative to tackle childhood obesity across New South
Wales by increasing the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in school canteens. Initially piloted at Goulburn Early
Childhood and Primary School, the program demonstrated significant success, reducing the consumption of processed foods
and fostering healthier eating habits among students. The pilot was completed under budget, costing $6,800 out of the
allocated $8,000. Based on these promising results, the program will now be rolled out statewide over three years, with
a budget of $6.8 million. This phased approach involves expanding to 10 schools during Stage 2, progressing to broader
regional rollouts, and concluding with a post-implementation review.

Recommendations:

1. Project Plan:
- Selected Plan: The phased rollout outlined in Task 2, which begins with small-scale implementation and gradually expands
to all regions in NSW.
- Rationale: This plan allows for continuous learning and refinement at each stage, addressing challenges effectively before
the broader rollout. The timeline ensures adequate time for stakeholder engagement, IT system implementation, and community involvement.

2. Service Quote:
- Selected Quote: Grove Acres' proposal of $2,048,130.
- Rationale: This quote offers the best value for money while ensuring comprehensive support. Grove Acres' experience in similar
projects ensures the quality and efficiency of service delivery.

3. Technology Solution:
- Selected Solution: Cloud-based inventory management software from Connect.
- Rationale: This solution offers robust security features, including data encryption and multi-factor authentication, to safeguard
sensitive data. Its automated invoicing, online stock ordering, and integration with POS systems streamline operations, improve
efficiency, and provide real-time inventory tracking.

Conclusion:
The proposed project plan, service provider, and technology solution collectively provide a scalable, secure, and efficient framework
to implement the initiative. This approach ensures the program's success and supports sustainable improvements in student health and
nutrition across NSW schools.

From: Jordan Smith, Team Leader
Subject: Work Health and Safety presentation

Hi, 

I have an interesting piece of work for you to go on with while I’m out of the office tomorrow. Would you have 30 minutes or so to
put together some ideas for me to present to Senior Management next week?

Senior Management has identified a need to launch an organisation-wide initiative to improve workplace health and safety. We want
to involve employees in our efforts to reduce the presence of health and safety hazards within the organisation and improve staff
wellbeing and productivity. 

However, a similar initiative was attempted a few years ago and there were various issues that prevented it from succeeding. There
was a lack of motivation and engagement from various members of staff who had been asked to join one of the Workplace Health and
Safety Committees. Attendance at the committees’ meetings was poor and meetings were often conducted in an unproductive manner.
Managers were concerned that some individuals were spending too much time away from their main duties, and that little change or
action occurred as a result of the Workplace Health and Safety Committee meetings. 

I’d like you to put together some recommendations to convince the rest of the organisation of the value of implementing the workplace
health and safety initiative again. The recommendations you develop should be as specific as possible and state exactly what course
of action is necessary. You should also anticipate all likely consequences of your recommendations when they are implemented and
suggest responses to each of the potential consequences. Include the advantages and disadvantages of each recommendation you make
and please mention an expected timeframe for briefing staff about the changes and implementation.  I don’t expect you to know a lot
about the issues, but please think about them from a common‑sense point of view. 

I’ll review your ideas when I’m back at work but I won’t have much time to prepare for next week’s meeting with Senior Management.
Would you please present your ideas in a 5-minute video presentation?

Kind regards, 
Jordan
```

- Here is the transcript of the video I presented to the team leader:
